# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is the first game I built using javascript. There is no graphics yet, but I hope to refactor this in the near future. I hope you enjoy the game

Realizations:
1. Programming is easier when there is pseudocode. It takes longer but once the pseudocode is written elaborately and detailed enough, programming is so much easier.
2. I do not know how to validate the input of the user yet. But I will learn them soon enough.
